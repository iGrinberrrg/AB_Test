📊 A/B Testing & Hypothesis Prioritization Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on prioritizing business hypotheses and analyzing the impact of an A/B test to optimize revenue for an online store. The dataset includes hypotheses, customer transactions, and visit logs, which are used to evaluate potential growth strategies.

📂 Datasets

hypotheses_us.csv: List of business hypotheses with impact metrics.

orders_us.csv: Data on customer transactions, revenue, and test groups.

visits_us.csv: Website visits segmented by A/B test groups.

🔍 Key Objectives

1️⃣ Hypothesis Prioritization

✔ Apply the ICE framework to rank hypotheses based on impact, confidence, and effort.
✔ Apply the RICE framework, incorporating user reach, to refine prioritization.
✔ Compare results from ICE and RICE and explain discrepancies.

2️⃣ A/B Test Analysis

✔ Cumulative Revenue Analysis: Compare revenue growth over time across test groups.
✔ Average Order Value: Identify differences in purchasing behavior.
✔ Conversion Rate Trends: Calculate and visualize conversion rates over time.
✔ Outlier Detection: Identify anomalies in order frequency and price.
✔ Statistical Significance: Conduct hypothesis tests to determine if differences are meaningful.
✔ Decision Making: Conclude whether to:

Stop the test and select a winning group.

Stop the test due to no significant difference.

Continue the test for further insights.
